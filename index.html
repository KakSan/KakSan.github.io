                    <br>A student at the Liger Leadership Academy - Cohort 2<br><br>
                    When I was back at my hometown in Kratie province, I always love to watch sun set at the riverside. Things started changing when I came to Liger. <br><br>In here, there is no time to watch sunset, so I dance, sing, draw, paint, write, sleep, eat, work, study instead. I am a curious person so <br><br>I'm crazy about researching things that interests me. <br><br>Beside all of the activities mentioned above, Watching YouTube videos is my hobby. I watched random things until I get bored and <br><br>starting doing something else, LOL!<br> 
                    
                    <br><br>Currently, I'm 15 years old. I was born on October, 12, 2004. Given that I really love doing arts like dancing, singing, drawing, <br><br>painting, creative writing....etc, I probably am going to become an artist in the future. <br><br>For now, I'm just trying to carry on my life and do my best in every field so that my 'future me' won't be disappointed. <br><br>
                    At Liger, there are 4 essential classes but I'm not interested in any of those. <br><br>I'm interested in psychology and I hope there will be some opportunities about it in the near future. <br><br>Out of the four though, I seem to be most interested in English Literacy class lead by Hannah Trivitt. <br><br>It's because I got to learn about new things and apply it into literacy works which sounds so fascinating to me!
